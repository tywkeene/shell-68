# Instructions:

    add.(b, w, l) {w}
        Op 1: Dn/An/(An)/Im/ea
        Op 2: Dn/(An)/An/ea

        Adds the value of the first operand to second operand. If the second
        operand is an address register, the ADDA instruction is used instead.

        Example: add.l (a4, d3), d1

    adda.(l, w) {w}
        Op 1: Dn/An/(An)/Im/ea
        Op 2: An

        Adds the value of the first operand to second operand. It does not
        change the SR. When using word size, the first operand is sign extended
        to long and the second is read and written as a long.

        Example: adda.l d0, a0

    addi.(b, w, l) {w}
        Op 1: Im
        Op 2: Dn/(An)/ea

        Op 1: Im
        Op 2: Dn/(An)/An/ea

        Adds the value of the first operand to second operand. The first operand
        value must be between 1 and 8. If the destination is a address register,
        it is always treated as a long, and the condition codes are not
        affected.

        Example: addq.w #4, d1

        Op 1: Im
        Op 2: Dn/(An)/ea

        accordingly which will be used by the branching instructions. Works by
        subtracting the first operand from the second operand and setting the
        flags. If the second operand is an address register, the CMPA

        Op 2: ea

        Decrements the first operand by 1 and branches to the specified address
        if {condition code} is false and the first operand is not -1. dbra is
        the same as dbf (will decrement untill it reaches -1). It reads the
        operand as a word, so it can run at maximum 64k times

        Example: `db<cc> d0, label` Where cc is one of the condition codes

    dbra
        Op 1: Dn
        Op 2: ea

        Decrements the first operand by 1 and branches to the specified address

        bits of the destination register. The first operand is read as a word,
        the second as a long

        Jumps to the specified address, like the "lea" instruction, when
        resolving the address, it does not read the memory, so "jsr 4(a0)" will

# Directives

    dc.(b, w, l)

        Defines constants, following the directive there can be a list of
        constants separated by commas, the size of each constant depends on the
        selected size. If no size is selected, the size is determined by the
        value of the constant. If the constant is a string, it will be stored as
        a sequence of bytes, if it is a number, it will be stored as a sequence
        of words

        Example: dc.b 'Hello world!', 4, %10, $F, @8, 'a', some_label

    ds.(b, w, l)

        Defines a space in memory of N elements, the size of each element
        depends on the specified size, the content of the space is undefined

        Example: ds.l 100

    dcb.(b, w, l)

        Defines a space in memory of N elements, the size of each element
        depends on the specified size, the content of the space is initialized
        to the second operand

        Example: dcb.b 50, 1

    org
        Sets the current position in memory for the following instructions

        Example: org $1000

    equ
        Defines a constant that will be replaced by the value when the program
        is assembled

        Example: name equ 10

# Addressing modes

    Direct:

        Gets the content in the register directly. (the SP register is an alias
        of the a7)

        Example: d0, a0, sp

        Dn: Data register
        An: Address register

    Indirect:

        Gets the value contained in memory with address being the content of the
        address register specified. Specifiying an offset by writing a number
        before the (), the addressing mode becomes indirect with displacement
        and the final address to read the memory will be (address + offset).

        Ex| (a0), 4(sp)
        (An) Indirect

    Indirect Post/Pre increment:

        Gets the value contained in memory with address being the content of the
        address register specified. If it's the post increment, the address
        register will be incremented after reading the memory. If it's the pre
        increment, the address register will be incremented before reading the
        memory. The amount of increment is specified by the size of the
        instruction. In the documentation, wherever there is (An), this
        addressing mode is valid too

        Ex| (a0)+, -(sp)
        (An): Post increment
        (An): Post increment

    Immediate

        Represents a numerical value, it can be a number or a label. When the
        program is assembled, the labels will be converted to the address of the
        label. Immediate values can be represented in many bases. (replace <num>
        with the actual number). Note, a string will be represented as a list of
        bytes.

        Ex| #1000, #$FF, #@14, #%10010, #'a', #'hey', #label

            Im: Immediate
            #<num>:  Decimal
            #$<num>: Hexadecimal
            #@<num>: Octal:
            #%<num>: Binary
            #'<char/string>: Text

    Effective address

        Represents the address of the memory where the data is stored. It can be
        a label or a number. When the program is assembled, the labels will be
        converted to the address of the label.

        Ex| $1000, some_label, 140, %101010, @22, 'e'

        ea    Effective address
        <ea>  Effective address

    Base displacement indirect

        Gets the value contained in memory with address being the sum of (address +
        offset + base), where the first register (address) will be the base address,
        the second register (base) and offset being the number before the (). In the
